A simple resolutions tracker. Alpha version. Should work in more generated manner with a visualisation of some kind.

Currently it just displays bunch of days and bunch of sins user wants put an end to.

There is a matrix of count of sins X count of days resolution is valid. The matrix constists of clickable squares. When clicked, the square changes its colour, meaning the resolution has been completed so far.

Submitted data are stored in 'mockDB' a file, that simulates very simple database. Therefore make sure the user who runs the script is allowed to create files within a directory script resides in.
